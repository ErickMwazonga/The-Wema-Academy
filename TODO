1. Use django's messaging app to notify users of the changes they make.
    Refer to the documentation, on how to use the SuccessMessageMixin. Refer to my code to.
    Also look how to integrate the messages in the template in my code or just google.

2. Write a custom filter to filter the marks into grades.
  It should be something like this {{ student.kcpe_marks|grade }} where grade is your
  custom filter.
  Refer to the docs.

 3. Look on how to use django's built in user authentication.
    Implement a login page
    Restrict views to logged users only.(using Django's LoginRequiredMixin)
        Refer to my code.
    This may take sometime to do


NB. You may need to google on what are mixins in python  because Django makes
extensive use of them.
