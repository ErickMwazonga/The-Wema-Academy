            The Wema Academy seeks to create a challenging learning environment that
            encourages high expectations for success through development-appropriate instruction
            that allows for individual differences and learning styles. Our school promotes a safe,
            orderly, caring, and supportive environment. Each student’s self-esteem is fostered by
            positive relationships with students and staff. We strive to have our parents, teachers, and community members actively involved on our students’ learning.
